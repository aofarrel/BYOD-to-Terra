# # BYOD -- Paternity Test
#
# ## Goal
# Generate a Terra data table from files that a user has uploaded into a workspace bucket, where each row represents a "parent" file and has cells for its "children." Parent files are things like CRAM, and child files are things like CRAI. It is named Paternity Test in the sense that parents and children are linked in the same table. What is determined to be a parent is set by the user specifying a file extension. Only one parent is allowed per data table.
#
# This sort of thing can be done on a local UNIX/UNIX-like machine using shell scripts, but that isn't ideal for certain BYOD scenarios. We need a way to do it programmatically (as there might be hundreds of files) and on the Terra platform itself (as the files might be coming from Windows, or the user doesn't know how to run a shell script), hence the motivation for this notebook's creation.
#
# ## Assumptions
# 1) You have a psuedo-folder in your Terra data section that contains BYOD data in the form of files
# 2) All of the files you want in your data table are in the same psuedo-folder, and are not in sub-psuedo-folders
# 3) You've uploaded all your files already -- Terra data tables are not dynamic, so if you want to add more later, you'll have to re-run this notebook
# 4) You are not trying to overwrite a data table you have already created. If you re-run this notebook and set TABLE_NAME to something that already exists as a Terra data table, the old table will NOT to overwritten. You will need to either pick a new name or delete the old table first.
#
# You do NOT have to have run File Finder before this notebook. The difference between this and File Finder is that File Finder will create a row for every file in your psuedo-folder, while Paternity Test will create a row for every parent file.
#
# Files that lack the parent file extension and are not children will NOT be added to the data table.

# ## Delete placeholder file (if you created folder with Folder Maker)
# Since there's now other files in the psuedo-folder (see Folder Maker for more info on why we are calling this a psuedo-folder), you can delete the placeholder file that Folder Maker made in order to prevent it from showing up in your TSV.

# Two methods have been included here.
#
# **Option 1, Single Child**, does NOT support the following use cases:
# * There is more than one child per parent
# * INCLUDE_PARENT_EXTENSION = False
# * You don't want to specify the child file extension
#
# **Option 2** supports all of these use cases, plus the single child use case. However, it might run slower than Option 1 if you have thousands of files.
#
# ### Expected runtimes
# | parent files | child 1 files | child 2 files | estimated time for Option 1 | estimated time for Option 2 |
# | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
# | 1000 | 1000 | 0 | 35 seconds | 130 seconds |
# | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | cannot handle | 340 seconds |

# ## Option 1: Single Child
# This will ONLY assign a single child to each parent. Additional children will be ignored. You must write the CHILD_FILETYPE in the cell below.
